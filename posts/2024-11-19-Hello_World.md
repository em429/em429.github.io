After years of procrastinating and over-engineering and abandoning multiple blog setuos, I finally decided to start simple and just write. I've been consuming too much information without sharing it.

This blog is intentionally minimal. No fancy frameworks, no complex build systems - just markdown files rendered with a bit of JavaScript.
